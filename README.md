Description:

This code involves internet scraping, statistics cleaning, and exploratory evaluation of charges accumulated from the "Quotes to Scrape" website. The code first scrapes rates, authors, and tags from the primary 5 pages of the website and organizes them right into a panda DataFrame. It then cleans the facts by converting tags into a comma-separated string, putting off duplicates, and checking for lacking values. The evaluation consists of identifying the most regularly quoted authors and not unusual tags and visualizing the use of Seaborn bar plots. Additionally, it calculates the number of particular authors and counts costs containing the word "life," providing insights into topics and styles inside the facts.
